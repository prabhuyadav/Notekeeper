jsx file extension is for some websites and editors to style the syntax accordingly but the executing and compiling that happens doesn't differ at all from that of a js extension so it doesn't matter that much if we keep all the extensions as js instead of jsx. index.js by convention is kept js and the components by conventions are kept jsx

React Properties(props)

when we are adding them as components we can create custom attributes to that component element and when we call this function it receives an object with these attributes name:values as keys and values of the object. so we can dynamically create components using diff data when we are including them as html component elements by passing diff data through custom attributes.check the Note component

for example we can't include className attribute in to the <Note /> element  there itself because in that case it will assume that we are trying to add another custom property className instead of recognizing as a JSX attribute. so html/jsx attrs should always go in the html elements and whatever attrs we add in our custom components will be treated as custom properties
